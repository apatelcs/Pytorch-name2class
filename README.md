# Python name2class

## Introduction
---
This is a small project following the tutorial found [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/char_rnn_classification_tutorial.html). This is a tutorial from the PyTorch webpage about recurrent neural networks (RNNs). This project aims to improve my familiarity with PyTorch and RNNs.

## How it is different from the PyTorch tutorial
---
This implementation differs slightly by training the RNN on the entire given dataset.
